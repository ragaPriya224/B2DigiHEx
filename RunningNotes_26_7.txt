1. abstract method, doesn't have a method body . 
in interface:
ketyword: implements

100% abstraction using interface only
By default, methods are abstract 
By default, methods are public 

 a class can extend only one class, but it can implement  any number of interfaces
 
 //interf1  extends  interf2

//Class1  implements Interf1


//class Class1  extends Class2

//Class1 extends Class2  implements Interf1,Interf2


// u can implement any number of interfaces, but only one class, u can extend

Exception:

In most cases, exceptions are caused by our program,  and these are recoverable 
Eg:

London 

local file ->


try{
// read data from a remote file @london file 
} catch(filenotfoundexception e ){
// use local file and continue 
}

ERROR:

* lack of resources
* mostly not caused by our program,s but due to lack of resources
non recoverable

Eg: out of memory error 

CheckedException:

 exceptions that are checked by compiler for smooth execution of code 
 Eg: filenotfound exception
 
 unchecked exception:
  exceptions that are not checked by compiler for smooth execution of code 
Eg: arithmetic  exception
