Write a program to print the names of students by creating a Student class. If no name is passed while creating an object of Student class, then the name should be "Unknown", otherwise the name should be equal to the String value passed while creating object of Student class.

Create a class 'Degree' having a method 'getDegree' that prints "I got a degree". It has two subclasses namely 'Undergraduate' and 'Postgraduate' each having a method with the same name that prints "I am an Undergraduate" and "I am a Postgraduate" respectively. Call the method by creating an object of each of the three classes.
