create a method to add two numbers and return it 
-------------------------
create a class named TestDemo , have 3 variable , 1 static and 1 non static method other the main methods

create a object of that class in same class and access the non static method
create another class as PracticeDemo and access the static method fromTestDemo
In PracticeDemo, try accessing the non static method of testdemo class
--------------------------------------

Question 1
Write a program with a method named getTotal that accepts two integers as an argument and return its sum. Call this method from main( ) and print the results.
Question 2
Write a method named isEven that accepts an int argument. The method should return true if the argument is even, or false otherwise
Question 3
Write a value-returning method, isVowel that returns the value true if a given character is a vowel, and otherwise returns false.
---------------------------------

create a class named Food with some variables and methods and then  create a object in same class, try to access these methods and variables
create a class called Pizza and create a object for food class and try to acces the variables and methods in it.

Java Program to Check Whether the Character is Vowel or Consonant
--------------------
Define a program to find out whether a given number is even or odd.
-------------------------
Write a program in Java to find out if a number is prime in Java?

------------------
Write a program to print the circumference and area of a circle of radius entered by YOU by defining your own method.
--------------------------------------------
Define a method that returns the product of two numbers entered by YOU
-------------------------------------.
Print multiplication table of 24, 50 and 29 using loop.
-----------------
Write an infinite loop.
A inifinte loop never ends. Condition is always true.
-----------------
If
x = 2
y = 5
z = 0
then find values of the following expressions:
a. x == 2
b. x != 5
c. x != 5 && y >= 5
d. z != 0 || x == 2
e. !(y < 10)

-------------------------------
Take values of length and breadth of a rectangle from YOU and check if it is square or not.
------------------------------------
Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' having two methods. First method named as 'setDim' takes length and breadth of rectangle as parameters and the second method named as 'getArea' returns the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth of rectangle are GIVEN BY YOU
--------------------
CREATE A AVENGER CLASS
CREATE CAPTAINAMERICA CLASS, BLACKWIDOW, IRONMAN CLASS
LET THESE CLASSES BE CHILD OF AVENGER
------------------------

CREATE A SPIDERMAN CLASS
CREATE A JUNIOR SPIDY CLASS, LET THIS CLASS BE CHILD OF SPIDERMAN, AND SPIDERMAN SHOULD BE CHILD OF AVENGER
-------------------------------

Create a class named 'Member' having the following members:
Data members
1 - Name
2 - Age
3 - Phone number
4 - Address
5 - Salary
It also has a method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the members.
Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 'Employee' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an employee and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same.
=---------------------------------

Create a class with a method that prints "This is parent class" and its subclass with another method that prints "This is child class". Now, create an object for each of the class and call
1 - method of parent class by object of parent class
2 - method of child class by object of child class
3 - method of parent class by object of child class
----------------------------
